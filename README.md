Studying Machine Learning

# Following Machine Learning in action
  This book presents from scratch codes that are considered the top 10 on the machine learning subject. They are:
  1- C4.5 (Trees)<br /><br />
  2- k-means<br />
  3- support vector machines<br />
  4- Apriori<br />
  5- Expectation Maximization<br />
  6- PageRank<br />
  7- AdaBoost<br />
  8- k-nearest-neighbours<br />
  9- Naive Bayes<br />

# Coding method of progression
Coding will be made in three steps:
1- Get algorithm working with simple data<br />
2- Get real-world data in a format usable by the algorithm <br />
3- Apply algorithm concept to the real-world scenario.
