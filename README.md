# MachineLearning
Studying Machine Learning

# Following Machine Learning in action
  This book presents from scratch codes that are considered the top 10 on the machine learning subject. They are:<br />
  1. C4.5 (Trees)<br />
  1. k-means<br />
  1. support vector machines<br />
  1. Apriori<br />
  1. Expectation Maximization<br />
  1. PageRank<br />
  1. AdaBoost<br />
  1. k-nearest-neighbours<br />
  1. Naive Bayes<br />
  1. -CART<br />
# Coding method of progression
Coding will be made in three steps:<br />
1. Get algorithm working with simple data<br />
1. Get real-world data in a format usable by the algorithm <br />
1. Apply algorithm concept to the real-world scenario.
