MachineLearning
Studying Machine Learning

Following Machine Learning in action
This book presents from scratch codes that are considered the top 10 on the machine learning subject. They are:

C4.5 (Trees)
k-means
support vector machines
Apriori
Expectation Maximization
PageRank
AdaBoost
k-nearest-neighbours
Naive Bayes
-CART
Coding method of progression
Coding will be made in three steps:

Get algorithm working with simple data
Get real-world data in a format usable by the algorithm
Apply algorithm concept to the real-world scenario.
Supervised Learning
Asks machine to learn from our data when we specify a target variable.
There's two cases of target variable:
1- Classification -> Target variable have nominal values [ex:True or False, strings, etc...]
2- Regression -> Target variable is numeric
